1BoringEPUB2PDF3GUI is a simple Python application that allows you to convert EPUB files to PDF format with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.

## Installation

To use this application, you'll first need to install a few Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install tkinter tkinterdnd2 ebooklib PyPDF2
```

If you're using a Debian-based Linux distribution, you can install tkinter by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Usage

To use 1BoringEPUB2PDF3GUI, simply run the script. A window will appear with a message saying "Drag and drop an EPUB file here." Drag and drop your EPUB file onto this window. You'll then be prompted to choose a location to save your PDF. Choose your location and click "Save". The program will then convert your EPUB file to a PDF.

## Note

Please be aware that due to the complexity of the EPUB format, some formatting may be lost in the conversion process.
